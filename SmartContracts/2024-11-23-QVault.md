# Proposal to include QVault Smart Contract

## Proposal
Allow QVault Smart Contract to be deployed on Qubic. 

## Available Options
> Option 0: no, dont allow

> Option 1: yes, allow


## Smart Contract Description
Qubic’s Smart Contract shares undergo an Initial Public Offering (IPO) using a Dutch auction model. For each smart contract, there are only 676 shares available. In Qubic’s first IPO, each of the 676 shares was priced at 15 billion $QUBIC—an amount beyond the reach of many small investors.

According to the Pareto principle, about 80% of outcomes result from 20% of causes. Qubic is no exception to this universal law. This means the wealthiest 20% of investors tend to own 80% of the Smart Contract (SC) shares, a fact that we can verify. The competition to acquire one of these limited 676 shares is intense, often leading to the same top investors securing the majority of them. As explained by Come-From-Beyond, this is a natural outcome of the Pareto principle, where the wealthiest investors tend to dominate the distribution of shares.

Clearly, the typical holder does not have enough capital to acquire these assets, making it impossible for them to invest in Smart Contract shares individually and earn passive income.

Qubic Capital’s solution to this problem is to allow smaller investors to pool their resources. By forming "investment pools", multiple investors can combine their funds, enabling them to collectively invest in Smart Contract shares that would otherwise be out of their financial reach. This approach democratizes access to these lucrative assets, allowing everyone to participate regardless of their individual financial capacity.

Through this "pooling system", revenues from Smart Contracts are redistributed proportionally based on each participant's contribution. The more you contribute to the "pool", the larger your share of the returns. This means that Qubic Capital is not just a solution for the wealthiest investors; it opens the door for a broader community to participate, grow their portfolios, and share in the benefits.

### What Will QVAULT Do?
QVAULT is designed to streamline the management of Qubic Capital’s assets, ensuring they are secure and efficiently utilized. The smart contract will also automate the weekly distribution of passive income to $QCAP holders, delivering revenue generated by these assets directly to their wallets. This contract represents a critical step toward decentralizing the management and revenue-sharing aspects of Qubic Capital.

The contract will handle:
- Secure asset management for Qubic Capital’s portfolio
- Automatic revenue distribution to $QCAP holders, eliminating the need for manual intervention
- Burning of $QUBIC through reinvestments in IPOs, actively reducing the token supply and supporting the Qubic ecosystem’s growth.

**Expected Outcomes**
Our project offers significant benefits to the entire Qubic ecosystem. With a single token ($QCAP), each holder will gain access to passive income, enjoy the potential appreciation of the token, and benefit from exposure to a wide range of assets. $QCAP holders won’t have to worry about reinvestment or rebalancing—our system will handle it all automatically.

Additionally, a portion of the revenue generated will be reinvested directly into $QUBIC by participating in IPOs (Initial Public Offerings), which will result in a permanent burning of tokens. This way, our project actively contributes to reducing the total supply of $QUBIC, benefiting the entire ecosystem.

For those who purchase shares in QVAULT, 3% of the revenue generated will be redistributed to them. This makes the QVAULT IPO an attractive opportunity for passive income while simultaneously supporting the burn mechanism of the ecosystem. (We are aiming to earn Trillions of $QUBIC per year)
