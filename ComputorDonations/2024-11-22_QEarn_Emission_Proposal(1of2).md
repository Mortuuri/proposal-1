# QEarn Proposal (1/2): Reduce Weekly Emission Burn Rate from 15% to 10%

## Summary  
We propose to adjust the weekly emission burn rate from currently 15% to 10%. The purpose of this change is to increase token allocation for QEarn and balance the weight between emissions and the burn rate.

## Available Options  
>Option 0: No
>Option 1: Yes, allow 
 
Here you find the [Second Part of the QEarn proposal](2024-11-22_QEarn_Emission_Proposal(2of2).md) to reallocate the freed up `$QUBIC` to the QEarn SC


## Impact  

- **Burn Rate Adjustment**:  
  Reducing the burn rate to 10% would lower the weekly burn from 150B to 100B `$QUBIC` based on a 1000B weekly emission.  

- **Increased Allocations**:  
  This adjustment frees up approximately 50B `$QUBIC` per week, which can be redirected to QEarn to strengthen the economy sustainably.  

## Implementation  
Upon approval, the burn rate adjustment will be implemented in the next epoch, ensuring that only 10% of weekly emissions are burned. The remaining amount will be allocated as part of QEarn Proposal (2/2).
