# Proposal to Fund the Development of a Wallet App for The Ledger Hardware Wallet

## Proposal
Send 44 billion QUBIC (roughly 65'000 USD) to the address `JXGMJLWEGFFORBQNEKGPIIZMQNYBNJKJSNWYJSAXDDCZCEZMQUBNGFHFWTMH` to create a Ledger hardware wallet integration.

> Option 0: no

> Option 1: yes, 44 billion QUBIC

## Overview
We are seeking 44 billion QUBIC for the integration of Qubic in the hardware wallet platform Ledger.

Ledger is a major hardware wallet provider and we want to offer our users the most relevant options to store their QUBIC in a safe place.

For this integration, we partner up with a software development agency which is skilled in developing such apps and also will support us through the auditing process.

The offer for the integration stands at approx 40k USD and for the security audit at around 20k USD and we add a 5k USD buffer for fluctuation in QUBIC price or additional expenditures.

## Success Indicators
- the app is available for the wallets Ledger Nano X, Nano S Plus, Stax, Flex, Nano
- it is possible to send funds from one wallet to another ("Send/Receive" according to this list: https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets, more functionality to follow later)

## Spending
The amount will be allocated to:
- Development services (the integration itself)
- Auditing of the produced software (by a third party)
- Audit on the side of Ledger

Any funds unspent (eg. because of appreciation of the price of QUBIC) will be returned to the CCF.
Funds are only for external expenses, no fees for project management/coordination are included.

## Timeline
If this proposal is accepted we anticipate a go-live in January. Unfortunately, the auditing process on the side of Ledger is a bottleneck and therefore it takes a long time to finalise.

@crypdro will receive the funds if the proposal is accepted. There will be a detailed report in how the funds have been spent.
