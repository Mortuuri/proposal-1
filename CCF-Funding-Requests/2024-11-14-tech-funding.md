# !DRAFT! Proposal to Fund the Development of the Qubic Core

## Proposal
Send 180 billion QUBIC (roughly 288'000 USD @1600$/bln) to the address `YYY` to support the further development of the Qubic Core.

> Option 0: no

> Option 1: yes, 180 billion QUBIC

## Overview
We are asking for 180 billion QUBIC for the further development of the Qubic Core. This Budget is to secure the runway for the next three months. (November 2024 - January 2025)
This funding secures that Qubic can grow. It allowes the developers to continue there work on Qubic.

### Provided Servives
- Builds the Qubic Core / Qubic Network (Protocol)
- Dedicates ~1FTE to build Smart Contracts (Help others, review code)
- Builds the Qubic Integration Layer (Archive, RPC/API, Event Pup/Sub)
- Operates the Qubic Integration Layer (RPC/API)
- Operates the Qubic Test Net
- Takes responsibility to maintain the Qubic Core/Integration Release/Versioning
- Maintains the Software created by Qubic Core Technology
- Writes documentation how the Qubic Core Technology works (in Code and written elsewhere)
- Supports other ecosystem builders in build on top of Qubic

### Maintained Products/Software
- Qubic Main Net
- Qubic Test Net
- Qubic RPC/API Infrastructure
- Qubic General Tech Support
- Qubic Smart Contract integration Support
- Qubic Core (https://github.com/qubic/core)
- Qubic CLI (https://github.com/qubic/qubic-cli)
- Qubic Archiver (https://github.com/qubic/go-archiver)
- Qubic Evetns (https://github.com/qubic/go-events)
- Qubic TS Library (https://github.com/qubic/ts-library)
- And many small tools around the Qubic Core

Details to the organizational structure are described [here](https://github.com/J0ET0M/qubic-doc/blob/main/QubicCoreTechnologyDraft.md)

## Success Indicators
- the Qubic network is in a stable state
- bugs are fixed in an appropriate time
- development is documented (https://github.com/orgs/qubic/projects/1/views/7) any member of the Qubic community can see who is working on what
- once a month (November, December, January) someone from the Qubic Core Technology holds an AMA/Presentation
- tech updates are given regularly inside of the qubic discord server
- the dev's are available for questions of the community and help ecosystem developers to onboard
- every repositiory maintained by the Qubic Core Technology has a proper desciption and a manual on how to clone/compile/run the project

## Cost break down
Each month costs:
- ~2'000$ for servers, test environment and what's currently needed to operate
- ~94'000$ for salaries (excl. cfb and j0et0m; [The People](https://github.com/J0ET0M/qubic-doc/blob/main/QubicCoreTechnologyDraft.md#the-people-behind))

## Spending
The amount will be allocated to:
- Salaries
- Operating Infrastructure (e.g. cloud servers, test servers)

Any funds unspent (eg. because of appreciation of the price of QUBIC) will either be returned to the CCF or taken to extend for the next period.

@j0et0m will receive the funds if the proposal is accepted and report the spendings

## Gouvernance
To ensure appropriate spending and management of the CCF funds, the Qubic Core Technology team will grant an independent community team access to all relevant documentation (e.g., salaries, expenditures).
Initially, we have agreed that @lex will be part of this auditing layer. An additional person will be recruited to form a tandem team in this role.
