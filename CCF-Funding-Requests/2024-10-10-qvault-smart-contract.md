> Option 0: no

> Option 1: yes

## Overview
Qubic Capital is seeking 5.5 billion $QUBIC to support the development and launch of its QVAULT smart contract. QVAULT will ensure the security of the assets held by the project and facilitate the automatic redistribution of revenue generated by these assets to the holders of $QCAP, the project’s native token. This funding will cover the costs of the developer, unforeseen expenses, and the marketing efforts required to launch $QCAP successfully. 

**What Will QVAULT Do?**
QVAULT is designed to streamline the management of Qubic Capital’s assets, ensuring they are secure and efficiently utilized. The smart contract will also automate the weekly distribution of passive income to $QCAP holders, delivering revenue generated by these assets directly to their wallets. This contract represents a critical step toward decentralizing the management and revenue-sharing aspects of Qubic Capital.

The contract will handle:
•    Secure asset management for Qubic Capital’s portfolio
•    Automatic revenue distribution to $QCAP holders, eliminating the need for manual intervention
•    Burning of $QUBIC through reinvestments in IPOs, actively reducing the token supply and supporting the Qubic ecosystem’s growth.

## Developer Information
We have selected Poly to develop QVAULT. Poly has a proven track record, having participated in the development of the QEARN smart contract, which demonstrates the technical skills necessary to ensure QVAULT is secure, reliable, and functional.

**Current Asset Management**
At present, Qubic Capital’s assets are safeguarded by Peterb, the sole individual with access. This ensures the project’s funds remain secure until the smart contract is fully operational.
**Expected Outcomes**
Our project offers significant benefits to the entire Qubic ecosystem. With a single token ($QCAP), each holder will gain access to passive income, enjoy the potential appreciation of the token, and benefit from exposure to a wide range of assets. $QCAP holders won’t have to worry about reinvestment or rebalancing—our system will handle it all automatically.

Additionally, a portion of the revenue generated will be reinvested directly into $QUBIC by participating in IPOs (Initial Public Offerings), which will result in a permanent burning of tokens. This way, our project actively contributes to reducing the total supply of $QUBIC, benefiting the entire ecosystem.

For those who purchase shares in QVAULT, a percentage of the revenue generated will be redistributed to them. This makes the QVAULT IPO an attractive opportunity for passive income while simultaneously supporting the burn mechanism of the ecosystem.

## Success Indicators
The success of the QVAULT smart contract will be measured by:
•    The number of $QCAP holders receiving weekly revenue distributions
•    The total amount of $QUBIC burned through reinvestments in IPOs
•    Growth in the number of $QCAP holders and ecosystem participants
•    Community engagement and satisfaction with automated revenue-sharing features

## Spending
We are requesting 5.5 billion $QUBIC. This amount will be allocated to:

•    Developer fees
•    Token launch and marketing
•    Contingency reserve

Wolf will be the one having control over the fund. A detailed report will be made public to provide full transparency regarding how the funds are being utilized.
